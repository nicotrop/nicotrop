### Hey there! ðŸ™Œ

I'm **Nico**, a full stack JavaScript developer and Shopify expert with a passion for building clean, modern web experiences.

I specialize in helping e-merchants build, optimize, and grow their online stores on the Shopify platform. Whether it's customizing the look and feel of a store, implementing new features, or improving the overall user experience, I love working with clients to bring their vision to life.

I have experience using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Express, and Nest.js, and I'm comfortable working with databases. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills and build cool projects.

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter [@playoffsnico](https://twitter.com/playoffsnico). I'd love to chat about my work as a developer and Shopify expert, or anything else!
